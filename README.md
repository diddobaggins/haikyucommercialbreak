# haikyucommercialbreak

A short program to play the music in the commercial break short of Haikyu, a manga by Furudate Haruichi. This program was written using ORCA-- and cannot be run without downloading ORCA and its synthesizer Pilot. I included a m4a file to play the short to avoid such unnecessary downloads.
